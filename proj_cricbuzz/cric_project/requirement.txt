DEPENDENCIES used in my project:


1. Python Standard Libraries

These are built into Python, so you usually don’t need to install them separately.

sqlite3 – For interacting with SQLite databases. You used this to create tables, insert data, and run SQL queries.

2. Data Manipulation & Analysis

pandas – Used for working with structured data (like SQL query results). Allows you to calculate averages, group data, and convert query results into DataFrames for visualization.

"pip install pandas"

4. Web Dashboard

streamlit – For building interactive dashboards. You can display tables, charts, and user controls like filters for year, player, or format.

"pip install streamlit" 

5. Web Requests / API
